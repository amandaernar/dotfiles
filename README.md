## Coding Setup

Configuration files for my computaitonal environment.


### Operating System

Arch Linux.

Linux, particularly the Arch distribution, helps me adhere to "KISS" (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

I built this operating system from the ground-up:

* Erased my computer's default operating system.
* Installed Arch via USB.
* Prepared and mounted computer disks.
* Installed everything basically (Image viewer, file explorer, window manager, terminal...)
* Wrote and maintained Bash scripts to customize my window manager, terminal, etc (which are in this repository).

### Window manager

* A *tiling* window manager.

### Terminal

### Text editor
[Neovim](https://github.com/amandaernar/dotfiles/blob/main/nvim/init.lua)
* Long story short, you don't use your computer mouse when using this text editor.
* You have to learn a set of keyboard bindings to move your cursor and edit text.
* I like using my keyboard. Without having to pick up the mouse, I speed up the coding process.
