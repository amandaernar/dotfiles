## Coding Setup

Configuration files for my computaitonal environment.


### Operating System

Arch Linux.

I built this operating system from the ground-up, as I've:

* Erased my computer's default operating system.
* Installed Arch via USB.
* Prepared and mounted computer disks.
* Did my research and installed what I needed (an image viewer, a file explorer, a window manager, a terminal...)
* Wrote and maintained Bash scripts to customize my environment.

***
Here is what I use.

### Window
[BSPWM](https://github.com/amandaernar/dotfiles/blob/main/bspwm/bspwmrc), a tiling window manager.

[Rofi](https://github.com/amandaernar/dotfiles/blob/main/rofi/config.rasi), an app launcher.

[Sxhkd](https://github.com/amandaernar/dotfiles/blob/main/sxhkd/sxhkdrc), a daemon that executes certain commands when I press certain keys. 

[Picom](https://github.com/amandaernar/dotfiles/blob/main/picom/picom.conf), a compositor that makes my desktop nicer.

### Terminal
[Kitty](https://github.com/amandaernar/dotfiles/blob/main/kitty/kitty.conf).

### Text editor
[Neovim](https://github.com/amandaernar/dotfiles/blob/main/nvim/init.lua), my go-to text editor. long story short you don't use your mouse when writing code in any vim-based text editor. i find that it speeds up the coding process. 
### Document Viewer
[Zathura](https://github.com/amandaernar/dotfiles/blob/main/zathura/zathurarc), a PDF viewer that uses vim keybindings to traverse the file.

Thunar, a file manager. Think of it like the *Finder* app in MacOS.

### Status bar
[Polybar](https://github.com/amandaernar/dotfiles/tree/main/polybar/config.ini), my desktop status bar.

### Audio
Pulseaudio.
